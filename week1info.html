    <h2>What we learnt :></h2>
   :> In week 1, we learnt about the different tools that were essential in everyones home. We were assigned to make a list of tools we thought were the most essential in terms of its cost, frequency of usage, as well as purpose
    
                
                
    <p><h2><u>My work</u></h2> </p>
            
    <p><h3>1.Screwdriver</h3></p>
    <b>Purpose:</b><br>
    -They are used for everything from putting together a piece of furniture, to removing light switch covers or tightening the knob on the kitchen cabinet door.<br>
 <b>Cost:</b><br>
    -$15<br>
   <b> Usage:</b><br>
    -quite frequently used in the household to maintain items<br>
   <p><h3> 2. Measuring tape</h3><br>
   <b>Purpose:</b><br>
    -It is a must-have in every home when you need to measure windows for curtains, how high to hang a picture, or whether a certain couch will fit in that perfect spot in your living room.<br>
   <b>Cost:</b><br>
    -$10.50<br>
     <b>Usage:</b><br>
    -used quite often when purchasing new furniture
     </p>
   
    <p>:> We also learnt abit about several software tools such as <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators" >Fusion 360</a> and text editors such as <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, and <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a>. We were then told to download Fusion 360 and a text editor of our choice (i chose to use brackets as i found the layout and presentation easier to understand!!)</p> 
    <p>:> Here's how Brackets look like!<br>
